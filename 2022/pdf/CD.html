<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>ABSTRACT: Large-scale nonlinear systems are widely studied via time-marching numerical simulations. Nonetheless, due to their inherent focus on the detailed evolution of a single initial condition, such simulations provide only a narrow view into the overall dynamics of a system as its parameters are varied. On the other hand, numerical continuation and bifurcation analysis focus on the time-asymptotic behavior of nonlinear systems from a state-space perspective. These tools efficiently generate `maps of solutions' that provide generic insight into the overall dynamic behavior of a system without interrogating specific initial conditions. In this talk, a framework for performing such analyses in systems of PDE's via FreeFEM/PETSc is discussed and demonstrated in the flow of a swirling jet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 899987.</p>
