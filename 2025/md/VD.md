## Modern Solvers for Time-Harmonic Waves: FreeFEM at Scale and a Glimpse Toward Learning-Driven Methods

##   Eindhoven University of Technology 


*Abstract:* 

Time-harmonic wave propagation remains one of the central challenges in large-scale computational science, with applications ranging from seismic exploration to high-frequency electromagnetics. Achieving accurate solutions at realistic frequencies requires not only robust discretization strategies but also highly optimized solver architectures capable of handling the strongly indefinite nature of Helmholtz-type operators.

In this talk, we explore recent advances in scalable solution strategies implemented in FreeFEM, focusing on domain decomposition approaches, coarse-space enrichment tailored to oscillatory regimes. We illustrate how these techniques combine to deliver fast, reliable solvers suitable for demanding real-world simulations. We conclude by highlighting emerging opportunities in which learning-based ideas may enhance or accelerate next-generation wave solvers.
