*Abstract* : Hydrogel-based bioprinting has found widespread applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery. Hydrogels behave like solids under slow and gentle deformation. However, when subjected to high deformation rates, the crosslinks between polymer chains can break, leading to a significant reduction in both viscosity and elasticity. As a result, the material properties become more fluid-like and injectable. Recently, we proposed a one-dimensional rheological model to describe the yielding and fluidization behavior of hydrogels. Building on this framework, we have extended the model into a general tensorial form and developed the numerical code using FreeFEM. Numerical simulations based on this model have been performed to predict the behavior of injectable hydrogels used in bioprinting. Three distinct flow regimes have been identified: (i) unyielded, (ii) partially yielded, and (iii) fully fluidized. These regimes have a direct impact on the injection process and the final bioprinting outcome.
