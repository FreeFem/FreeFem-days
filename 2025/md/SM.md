##  Lowest-Order Nonstandard Finite Element Methods for Time-Fractional Biharmonic Problem

##  Shantiram Mahata Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden

*Abstract:* 
 This talk focuses on the lowest-order nonstandard finite element methods for the time-fractional biharmonic problem. We state the well-posedness result and discuss several popular lowest-order nonstandard piecewise-quadratic finite element schemes, namely, Morley, discontinuous Galerkin, and C^0 interior penalty methods. We present optimal order error bounds for both smooth and nonsmooth initial data with illustrating numerical examples.
