*Abstract:*  FreeFEM-cs is an integrated environment for FreeFEM. It provides an intuitive graphical interface with a color-coded editor where undefined variables are highlighted in red, a compilation window which links back to the source code, and integrated 3D graphics. This talk will describe how FreeFEM-cs can be used to experiment with the finite element method after one single download. https://www.ljll.fr/lehyaric/ffcs
