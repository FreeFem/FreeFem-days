the aim on the work is to computed the distance of a isoline a border in a bootle.

I propose to way , One build is a emtyp mesh beetween the border and the isoline. 
and after to compute the distance just use the bacis geometric theorem
the heigth of a triangle is 2*area of T / lenght of base
see dist-with-mesh-generation.edp

the other way is to use the soft of C. Dapogny to compute the distance to a level set.
fisrt compile de solf mshdist soft and copy the program mshdist in a PATH directory 
I do on my laptop.   
  874  mkdir mshdist
  875  cd mshdist
  876  tar zxvf ../mshdist.2014.12.03.tgz 
  877  make
  878  cp bin/mshdist ~/bin 
  

now use dist.edp exemple.
