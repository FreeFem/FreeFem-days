The problem is to bluid a matrix which the distance 
of 2 barycentre if the discent is less than epsilon

1) the  file closebary.edp is a example   is a example to compute the barycentre and the list point with 
distance less than eps

2) the TrivialMatrix-test.edp	TrivialMatrix.cpp is just un test to buyild a matrix...  

3) the result CloseMatrix.cpp  CloseMatrixtest.edp
