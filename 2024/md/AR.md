Abstract: With the intention to study Breaking Water Waves, we propose a new numerical method to study
the 2d Navier-Stokes equations with a lagrangian interface advection scheme implemented in FreeFem.
The mesh being advected with the fluid, the interpolation error is rather small, leading to a fast convergence. 
At the same time, this method is very stable, allowing to decrease the viscous dissipation to values that were never achieved before. 
This allowed us to compare the Navier-Stokes solution with Euler's one and investigate 
whether the effects of viscosity are important when describing (potentially breaking) Water Waves.
