*Abstract*:  PyFreeFEM is a Python package enabling users to leverage FreeFEMâ€™s finite element analysis capabilities within the Python ecosystem.
 PyFreeFEM provides an intuitive interface for facilitating data exchanges between these two environments,
  making it easy to integrate with Python-based workflows. This presentation will introduce the main features of PyFreeFEM 
  and will demonstrate its utility in a topology optimization code.
