*Abstract*:  Conjugate heat transfer problems require connected geometry with continuity in temperature and heat fluxes.
 The code-based FreeFEM geometry has the advantage of having total control over the domain for solution strategy,
  data extraction and manipulation. However, this brings the complexity of carefully tailored measurements to suit the problem description. 
  The presentation describes simplified geometry manipulations using mathematical functions and transformations to create intricate geometry.
   In the current work, a conjugate heat transfer problem involving such code-generated geometry is discussed.
